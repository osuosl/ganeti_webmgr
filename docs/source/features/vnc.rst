VNC
===

Ganeti Web Manager provides an in browser console using noVNC, an HTML5
client. noVNC requires WebSockets to function. Support for older
browsers is provided through a flash applet that is used transparently
in the absence of WebSockets.

`VNC AuthProxy <http://code.osuosl.org/projects/twisted-vncauthproxy>`_
is required for the console tab to function. VNC servers do not speak
websockets and our proxy allows your ganeti cluster to sit behind a
firewall, VPN, or NAT.

VNCAuthProxy has a control channel that is used to request port
forwarding to a specific VNC machine. It will respond with a local port
and temporary password that must be used within a short period. This
allows a secure connection with the VNCAuthProxy, without compromising
the vnc password, and without leaving the port open to anyone with a
port scanner.

Configuring VNC AuthProxy
-------------------------

Set the host and port that the proxy uses in **settings.py** with the
**VNC\_PROXY** setting.

Syntax is **HOST:CONTROL\_PORT**, for example: "localhost:8888".

If the host is localhost then the proxy will only be accessible to
clients and browsers on the same machine as the proxy. Production
servers should use a public hostname or IP.

::

    # located in settings.py
    VNC_PROXY='localhost:8888'

Starting the Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Twisted VNC Authproxy is started with twistd, the twisted daemon.
Eventually we will include init.d scripts for better managing the
daemon.
::

    twistd --pidfile=/tmp/proxy.pid -n vncap

Starting Flash Policy Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browsers that do not support WebSockets natively are supported through
the use of a flash applet. Flash applets that make use of sockets must
retrieve a policy file from the server they are connecting to. Twisted
VNCAuthProxy includes a policy server. It must be run separately since
it requires a root port. You may want to open port 843 in your firewall
for production systems.

Start the policy server with twistd

::

    sudo twistd --pidfile=/tmp/policy.pid -n flashpolicy

Firewall Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following ports are used by default

-  **8888:** Control port used to request vnc forwarding. Should be open
   between **Ganeti Web Manager** and **Proxy**
-  **12000+:** Internal VNC Ports assigned by **Ganeti**. Should be open
   between **Proxy** and **Ganeti Nodes**.
-  **7000-8000:** External VNC Ports assigned by **Proxy**. Should be
   open between **Proxy** and **Clients/Web Browsers**.
-  **843:** Flash policy server. Required to support browsers without
   native websocket support. Should be open between **Proxy** and
   **Clients/Web Browsers**.

Debugging Help
--------------

Python Path for flash policy server 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error indicates that your python path is not set or the
proxy is not installed.

::

    /usr/bin/twistd: Unknown command: flashpolicy

Ensure that your virtualenv is active

::

    source venv/bin/activate

If not using a virtualenv, then you must manually set the **PYTHONPATH**
environment variable as root.

::

    export set PYTHONPATH=.
