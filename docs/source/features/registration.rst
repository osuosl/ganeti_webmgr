Open Registration
=================

Ganeti Web Manager versions 0.8 and above allow you to choose whether
users can create their own accounts, or need to be added by an
administrator.

The default setting for registration is open, which means that visitors
to your site's login page can follow a link from the login page to
create their own accounts.

The "Not a member?" link takes the user to the registration page:

   :align: center

The user is emailed a password and a confirmation link, then has an
account on your site. Users can also be added by a site admin by
selecting the users link in the admin toolbar, then using the Add User
button to reach the user creation form.

Closing Registration
--------------------

In some contexts, users should not be able to create their own accounts.
To implement this, simply change the ALLOW\_OPEN\_REGISTRATION setting
in your settings.py file to False:
::

    # Whether users should be able to create their own accounts. 
    # False if accounts can only be created by admins. 
    ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION = False

This setting is currently located near line 203, below the registration
email settings.

Result of closed registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Not a member?" link is hidden from users on the login page. If they
navigate to the <SITE\_ROOT>/accounts/register page, they will see this
message instead of the account creation form:
