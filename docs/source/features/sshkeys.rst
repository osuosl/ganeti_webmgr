SSH Keys
========

.. todo::
   This really needs to be tested and updated. I (Trevor) have never
   personally worked with ssh keys, or tested getting them to the
   server. Our internal script might also be different.

Ganeti Web Manager allows users to store SSH Keys. Each virtual machine
has a view that will return SSH keys for users with access.

Configuring User SSH Keys
-------------------------

As an User
~~~~~~~~~~

#. click your **username** in the menu sidebar
#. use the Add, Edit, and Delete buttons to manage your keys

As an Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. click **Users** in the menu sidebar
#. click the edit button for the user you want to edit
#. use the Add, Edit, and Delete buttons to manage your keys

SSH Keys script
---------------

Ganeti Web Manager provides a script that will automatically generate an
authorized\_keys files

::

    $ python util/sshkeys.py [-c CLUSTER [-i INSTANCE]] API_KEY URL

-  **API\_KEY** is the value set in **settings.py**
-  **URL** is a URL pointing to the GWM server
-  **CLUSTER** is the identifier of a cluster
-  **INSTANCE** is the hostname of an instance

The GWM server URL has some flexibility in how it may be specified; HTTP
and HTTPS are supported, as well as custom port numbers. The following
are all valid URLs:

-  http://example.com/
-  https://example.com/
-  http://example.com:8080/

**CLUSTER** and **INSTANCE** are optional. Including them will narrow
the list of users to either a **Cluster** or a **VirtualMachine**.

SSH Keys Ganeti hook
--------------------

If you want your VMs to automatically copy the ssh keys from GWM, then
you can use the included ssh keys ganeti hook found in
**util/hooks/sshkeys.sh**. Copy that file onto every node in your
cluster in the hooks directory for the instance definition you're using
(i.e. ganeti-debootstrap). Copy and set the variables in
**util/hooks/sshkeys.conf** into the variant config and/or the
instance definition config file. Make sure that the hook is executable
and all the variables are set include changing the API Key.
