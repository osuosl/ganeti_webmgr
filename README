 Installation
================================================================================

*Note*: Installing from the tarball is the preferred method. After installing
the dependencies, please download the tarball instead of cloning the repository.

Overview

    1. Install dependencies: Python, Pip, Fabric, VirtualEnv
    2. Get the Ganeti Web Manager code: Clone from the repository or download
        a release tarball
    3. Deploy fabric environment: fab dev deploy or fab prod deploy
    4. Configure Settings: Copy settings.py.dist to settings.py and make any 
        modifications
    5. Sync database, then run the server: ./manage.py syncdb --migrate, then 
        ./manage.py runserver

This section explains how to automatically install Ganeti Web Manager using 
Fabric: http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.0.1/index.html.  Fabric simplifies the 
installation process by automatically installing dependencies into a virtual 
environment.

Compatibility

Ganeti Web Manager is compatible with the following:

  Ganeti (http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/)
       Ganeti >= v2.2.x is supported. v2.1.x and v2.0.x are unsupported and sometimes 
       work but can cause problems (see #8973). Lower versions are **not** 
       supported.

  Browsers: 
      Mozilla Firefox (http://mozilla.com/firefox) >= v3.x, 
      Google Chrome: (http://www.google.com/chrome/) 
        or Chromium: (http://code.google.com/chromium/)

      Other contemporary browsers may also work, but are not supported. (The 
      web-based VNC console requires browser support of WebSockets 
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets) and HTML5 
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5).

  Databases: 
      MySQL or SQLite. SQLite is not recommended in production environments.
      
  Operating Systems: 
      GWM has been tested on Debian 7, Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04 and CentOs 5 and 6. 
      Debian 6 is supported, provided the Pip, Virtualenv and Fabric packages 
      are updated to the versions listed below. 

Dependencies

    Python: >=2.5, python >=2.6 recommended
    Pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html >= 0.8.2
    Fabric: http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.0.1/index.html >=1.0.1
    VirtualEnv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv >= 1.6.1

Pip is required for installing Fabric and a useful tool to install Virtualenv

    * install pip
      $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

    * devel libraries may be needed for some pip installs
      $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

    * install fabric and virtualenv
      $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
      $ sudo apt-get install fabric

Note: the use of pip to install system packages is not recommended, please use 
your system's package manager to install Virtualenv and Fabric. 

Install with Fabric

Either download and unpack the "latest release" from 
http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/files, or check it out from the 
repository:

  $ git clone git://git.osuosl.org/gitolite/ganeti/ganeti_webmgr

Switch to project directory
(Fabric commands only work from a directory containing a fabfile)

  $ cd ganeti_webmgr/

Run Fabric to automatically create python virtual environment with required 
dependencies.  Choose either production or development environment

  * production environment
      
    $ fab prod deploy

  * development environment
      
    $ fab dev deploy</pre>

  * activate virtual environment

    $ source bin/activate

Configuration

In the project root, you'll find a default settings file called settings.py.dist 

Copy it to settings.py:

    $ cp settings.py.dist settings.py

If you want to use another database engine besides the default SQLite (not 
recommended for production), edit settings.py, and edit the following lines to 
reflect your wishes (*note that postgresql is not supported at this time and 
the install will fail*, see issue #3237):

DATABASE_ENGINE = ''   # <-- Change this to 'mysql', 'postgresql', 
                              'postgresql_psycopg2' or 'sqlite3'
DATABASE_NAME = ''     # <-- Change this to a database name, or a file for 
                              SQLite
DATABASE_USER = ''     # <-- Change this (not needed for SQLite)
DATABASE_PASSWORD = '' # <-- Change this (not needed for SQLite)
DATABASE_HOST = ''     # <-- Change this (not needed if database is localhost)
DATABASE_PORT = ''     # <-- Change this (not needed if database is localhost)


Initialize Database:
  
    $ ./manage.py syncdb --migrate

Build the search indexes:

    $ ./manage.py rebuild_index
  
    Note: running ./manage.py update_index on a regular basis ensures that the 
      search indexes stay up-to-date when models change in Ganeti Web Manager. 

Everything should be all set up! Run the development server with:

    $ ./manage.py runserver

Additional configuration for production servers:

Deploying a production server requires additional setup steps.

    1. Change the ownership of the @whoosh_index@ directory to apache

        $ chown apache:apache whoosh_index/

    2. Change your *SECRET_KEY* and *WEB_MGR_API_KEY* to unique (and hopefully 
        unguessable) strings in your settings.py.

    3. Configure the Django Cache Framework 
        (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/) to use a production 
        capable backend in *settings.py*.  By default Ganeti Web Manager is 
        configured to use the *LocMemCache* but it is not recommended for 
        production.  Use Memcached or a similar backend.

        CACHES = {
            'default': {
                'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
            }
        }

    4. For versions >= 0.5 you may need to add the full filesystem path to your 
        templates directory to TEMPLATE_DIRS and remove the relative 
        reference to 'templates'. We've had issues using wsgi not working 
        correctly unless this change has been made.

    5. Ensure the server has the ability to send emails or you have access to 
        an SMTP server. Set EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, and DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL in 
        settings.py. For more complicated outgoing mail setups, please refer to
        the django email documentation
          (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/email/)

    6. Follow the django guide to deploy with apache.
        (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modwsgi/)
        Here is an example mod_wsgi file:

          import os
          import sys

          path = '/var/lib/django/ganeti_webmgr'

          # activate virtualenv
          activate_this = '%s/bin/activate_this.py' % path
          execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this))

          # add project to path
          if path not in sys.path:
              sys.path.append(path)

          # configure django environment
          os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings'

          import django.core.handlers.wsgi
          application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()


    7.  Enable the periodic cache updater.
        *NOTE*: Do not run the cache updater as root.

        $ twistd --pidfile=/tmp/gwm_cache.pid gwm_cache

    You may encounter an issue where twisted fails to start and gives you an 
    error. This is usually caused by the environment variable PYTHONPATH not 
    being exported correctly if you switch to superuser 'su -'. To fix it type:
    
        $ export PYTHONPATH="."
    
    Then exit out of root.

    8. Set VNC_PROXY to the hostname of your VNC AuthProxy server in 
        settings.py.  The VNC AuthProxy does not need to run on the same server 
        as Ganeti Web Manager.

          VNC_PROXY = 'my.server.org:8888'

================================================================================
 Ganeti RAPI users and passwords
================================================================================

Before you can start using Ganeti Web Manager, you will need to create a user
and password on the Ganeti cluster.

Here is an example with user "jack" and password "abc123":

    $ echo -n 'jack:Ganeti Remote API:abc123' | openssl md5

Add the hash to the RAPI users file and restart ganeti-rapi. Depending on the
version of Ganeti you are running, you will need to either use
`/var/lib/ganeti/rapi_users` (Ganeti <=2.3.x ) or
`/var/lib/ganeti/rapi/users` (Ganeti >=2.4.x ).

An example hash entry might look like the following:

    # Hashed password for jack
    jack {HA1}54c12257ee9be413f2f3182435514aae write

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Managing_Clusters#Ganeti-RAPI-users-and-passwords


================================================================================
 Importing a Cluster
================================================================================

1. Use the admin user created during syncdb to log in.
2. Import a cluster:  Clusters -> Add Cluster
3. Fill out properties and click save

When the cluster is created it will automatically synchronize the list of
Virtual Machines with information from the Ganeti cluster.

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Importing_a_Cluster


================================================================================
 Users, Groups, and Permissions
================================================================================

Permissions may be granted to both clusters and virtual machines. The
permissions system is intended to allow users to manage themselves. Any object
that can have its permissions edited will have a Users tab.

Adding users to objects:
  1. Navigate to Group, Cluster, or Virtual Machine detail page
  2. Click Add New User
  3. Select user or group
  4. Select permissions
  5. Save

Updating permissions:
  1. Navigate to Group, Cluster, or Virtual Machine detail page
  2. Click Users tab
  3. Click permissions column
  4. Select permissions and save

Deleting permissions:
  1. Navigate to Group, Cluster, or Virtual Machine detail page
  2. Click Users tab
  3. Click the delete icon

Deleting a user will remove all permissions, and other properties associated
with the user such as cluster quotas.

Users may belong to any number of user groups.  User groups can be assigned
permissions and quotas just like users.  Users inherit permissions from groups
and may act on their behalf to create virtual machines.

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Permissions


================================================================================
 Assigning Quotas
================================================================================

Quotas restrict the usage of cluster resources by users and groups. Default
quotas can be set by editing clusters, if no quota is set unlimited access is
allowed. This will affect all users and groups.

The default quota can be overridden on the cluster users page:

   1. Clusters -> Cluster -> Users
   2. Click on the quota
   3. Edit values

Leaving a value empty specifies unlimited access for that resource.

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Permissions#Quotas


================================================================================
 Orphaned Virtual Machines
================================================================================

You can find Virtual Machines with no permissions via Admin -> Orphaned VMs.
This will force a synchronization of all clusters and display Virtual Machines
that do not have any permissions assigned.

You only need to grant permissions directly on virtual machines if you are
granting access to non-admin users.

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Managing_Clusters#Orphaned-Virtual-Machines


================================================================================
 Cache System
================================================================================

Ganeti Web Manager uses a cache system that stores information about Ganeti
clusters in the database. This allows the following:

      ---  Ganeti  ---
     /                \
    /                  \
 Cluster ->       <-   Bulk
  Model  <- cache <-  Updater

    * Permissions are stored in the database and are associated to the cached
      objects
    * The cached data can be searched and or filtered
    * Limits the amount of traffic between the web server and Ganeti cluster.

The cache system is transparent and will load cached data automatically when
the object is initialized.

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/Cache_System

================================================================================
 VNC 
================================================================================

Ganeti Web Manager provides an in browser console using noVNC [1], an HTML5
client.  noVNC requires WebSockets to function. Support for older browsers is
provided through a flash applet that is used transparently in the absence of
WebSockets.

[1] https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC

Also see: http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr/wiki/VNC

================================================================================
 VNC AuthProxy
================================================================================

VNC Auth proxy [1] is required for the console tab to function. VNC servers do
not speak websockets and our proxy allows your ganeti cluster to sit behind a
firewall, VPN, or NAT.

Enabling in settings.py
-----------------------

Set the host and port that the proxy will be running at with the VNC_PROXY
setting. For development this is typically "localhost:8888" but for production
you would use the name of the server its running on. See the instructions in
settings.py for more details.

Starting the Daemon
-------------------

Twisted VNC Authproxy is started with twistd, the twisted daemon. Eventually we
will include init.d scripts for better managing the daemon. You may want to open
port 8888 in your firewall for production systems.

    $ twistd --pidfile=/tmp/proxy.pid -n vncap

Starting Flash Policy Server
----------------------------

Browsers that do not support WebSockets natively are supported through the use
of a flash applet. Flash applets that make use of sockets must retrieve a policy
file from the server they are connecting to. Twisted VNCAuthProxy includes a
policy server. It must be run separately since it requires a root port. You may
want to open port 843 in your firewall for production systems.

Start the policy server with twistd

    $ sudo twistd --pidfile=/tmp/policy.pid -n flashpolicy


Possible issues
---------------
You may encounter an issue where twisted fails to start and gives you an error.
This is usually caused by the environment variable PYTHONPATH not being
exported correctly if you sudo up to root. To fix it type:

    $ export PYTHONPATH="."

Try executing twisted again and it should work.

================================================================================
 SSH Keys
================================================================================

Ganeti Web Manager allows users to store SSH Keys. Each virtual machine has a
view that will return SSH keys for users with access. This can be used as a
Ganeti post-install hook to deploy user's keys on the VMs.

To allow VMs to copy keys, copy util/hooks/sshkeys.sh to the instance
definition hooks directory on every node in the cluster and make the file
executable. Next, add the required variables to the variant config file
or main instance definition config file. The config file can be found in
util/hooks/sshkeys.conf and includes documentation for each variable.
