"""
Capabilities for clusters.

This module can classify clusters into a capability group, and provides some
helpful utility functions for determining what clusters are capable of doing.

Versions recognized by this module (and GWM at large):

 * ANCIENT: Ganeti from before the dawn of time. Ganeti 2.1 and earlier, as
   well as any unrecognized versions.
 * GANETI22: Ganeti 2.2.x
 * GANETI23: Ganeti 2.3.x
 * GANETI24: Ganeti 2.4.x prior to 2.4.2
 * GANETI242: Ganeti 2.4.2 and newer in the 2.4.x series
 * GANETI25: Ganeti 2.5.x
 * GANETI26: Ganeti 2.6.x
 * FUTURE: Ganeti which probably is newer than, and somewhat
   backwards-compatible with, the newest version of Ganeti which GWM
   officially supports.

Note that all bets are off if the cluster's version doesn't correspond to the
x.y.z (major.minor.patch) versioning pattern.
